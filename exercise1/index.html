              Winter/National Geographic PDF version Central India — The Maruti
              Gypsy 44 sped along a jungle track, jolting us out of our seats.
              We had signed up for a wolf safari, but the trip leader had
              another quarry in mind. The vehicle barrelled towards a pungent
              smell on a hillside — a fresh tiger kill.
            </p>
            <p>
              The forest guide spoke to one of his colleagues in a different
              vehicle and then barked at our driver to rush towards a nearby
              meadow. A tigress and four cubs are at a watering hole just beyond
              our sights, he said.

              We had signed up for a wolf safari, but the trip leader had
              another quarry in mind. The vehicle barrelled towards a pungent
              smell on a hillside — a fresh tiger kill. The forest guide spoke
              to one of his colleagues in a different vehicle and then barked at
              our driver to rush towards a nearby meadow. A tigress and four
              cubs are at a watering hole just beyond our sights, he said. A
              full Moon rose, and revealed an ink-blue landscape. Handheld
              lights were banned, so visibility was at 3 metres. The phone rang,
              and the guide instructed the driver, who raced on a rollercoaster
              route back to the kill site. No tiger. We dashed back to the
              meadow, a second vehicle in hot pursuit. It felt ugly, like a
              hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two circuits later, the Moon was high over the meadow when we were
              beckoned once more back to the kill site. We raced there to find
              four Gypsys, the drivers using their headlights to sweep the
              hillside. Another vehicle banged into ours. Our guide cursed. Then
              silence, as the drivers shut off the engines. Tourists stood on
              seats, peering through telephoto lenses.
